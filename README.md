### Hey! I'm Kieran 👋

I'm currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science @ the University of Michigan-Dearborn (expected May 2027). Go Blue! 〽️

I am always studying the best software design principles and trying to keep up with the ever evolving world of software. My dream is to become a Software Engineer at Google.

Outside of studying, you'll find me doing a plethora of things:
- 🇵🇭 Filipino Americans in Tech (Founder)
- ⚡ Hackathons
- 📺 Watching F1 or Anime
- 📚 Reading
- 💪 Gyming
- ✈️ Traveling
- 🏎️ Driving cars or riding motorcycles

Feel free to send me a DM on LinkedIn if you want to connect :)
